<p>What Are The Fixed Features of Your Home?</p><p>Before diving into color options, consider your home's fixed features – elements you won't be altering, like brick, stone, roof shingles, and more. Categorize these features into cool-toned (with blue, green, or purple undertones) or warm-toned (featuring red, yellow, or orange undertones).</p><p>Knowing the overall tone guides you in selecting paint colors that harmonize with your fixed features. The beauty is that a vast range of colors offers both cool and warm variations, granting you numerous choices.</p><p>The Sherwin Williams Color Visualizer</p><p>While nothing compares to physically testing paint samples, the Sherwin Williams Color Visualizer serves as a fantastic virtual tool. Explore color combinations for both interior and exterior spaces. Whether utilizing preset templates or uploading your home's photo, this tool aids in narrowing down color preferences.</p></div>

<div><p>Test samples are your friends in the journey to the perfect color. A small swatch – ideally 1'x1' or up to 2'x2' – gives you a genuine feel of how colors appear under various lighting conditions. Remember that light impacts color perception throughout the day, so experimenting with a sample helps in making the right choice.</p><p>Sticking With Your Colors?</p><p>Even when sticking to your current color palette, communicate your color's name and code to your painter (e.g., Pure White SW 7005). Accurate codes ensure the correct paint is ordered for your project.</p><p>Find Your Color Codes</p><p>Inspect old paint cans for color name and code stickers. For cans with "Custom Match," a Sherwin Williams or Benjamin Moore retailer can help with matching.</p></div>
